# 2. Adopt sqlc for data integration

Date: 2024-03-19

## Status

Accepted

## Context

In order to query the database, we need to decide on what level of tooling support is appropriate, and there is a wide
range, from heavyweight ORMs to writing plain SQL with the standard library's SQL package. We were keen to avoid the 
pain points encountered using Doctrine in Sirius but were also conscious of the lack of safety in using plain SQL strings.

## Decision

sqlc is a SQL library generator that takes a schema (including migration files) and queries written in plain SQL and generates
structs and query functions, statically and prior to compilation. This means it has none of the performance overheads or 
bespoke DSLs of ORMs while providing guaranteed type safety. As the queries are effectively typechecked ahead of compilation,
this also reduces the testing burden.

## Consequences

As the developers are already familiar with SQL and the library abstracts away the database connection handling, this 
should have a fairly light learning curve. However, the schema itself was generated initially through Doctrine, so there
is a slight risk that some tables and relations are not properly normalised.
