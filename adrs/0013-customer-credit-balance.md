# 11. Customer Credit Balance

Date: 2024-07-23

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Managing client payments not only means allocating funds to debits on invoices but handling any overpayments or adjustments
that may be made in error or due to changing situations. This forms credit on the account, known as the "Customer Credit
Balance". At any time, we need to know the amount of credit on account, and be able to reapply those funds to new invoices.
